# betterTUI - collection of curses widgets for building TUI's

The purpose of betterTUI is to make creating TUI's in python with navigation, input
and colors easy and fast. I developped this library over curses because I could not find any others
which accomplished this goal. If you want to contribute to the library, you are welcome to add
Issues/PullRequests and I will look at them ASAP!
